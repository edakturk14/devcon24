# Devcon 2024 Workshop

Welcome to the Devcon 2024 Workshop! In this session, weâ€™ll build a **gasless NFT minting app** using **Scaffold-ETH 2**. You'll learn to set up your development environment, deploy an ERC721 NFT contract, and integrate a paymaster to cover gas fees for your users. By the end, you'll have a fully functional and user-friendly NFT minting app that allows users to mint NFTs without paying for gas, using the Coinbase Smart Wallet.

### Tools & Resources We'll Use

- Scaffold-ETH 2: A developer toolset for building decentralized apps quickly.
- Foundry: A blazing-fast, modular toolkit for Ethereum smart contract development.
- ERC-4337: The EIP that enables Account Abstraction, foundational for the Coinbase Smart Wallet.
- ERC-7677: Set Up Paymaster with ERC-7677 for gas sponsorship
- ERC-721: Standard for NFT contracts.
- DaisyUI: A Tailwind CSS-based component library for styling.

## Step-by-step

### 1. Set Up an SE2 App

- **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have **Foundry** installed and ready to use.
- **Note**: When creating the app, **do not add extra spaces** in the title.

```
npx create-eth@latest
```

- Start the app

```
yarn chain // start your local anvil chain
yarn deploy // deploy contracts to your local Anvil chain
yarn start // start the app
```

### 2. Add an NFT Contract

- Create a new contract file in the `app/foundry` folder.
- Implement an **ERC721 contract** using **Solmate**. Refer to this guide for help: [Solmate NFT Tutorial](https://book.getfoundry.sh/tutorials/solmate-nft).

```
// Example ERC721 Contract
contract MyNFT is ERC721 {
    // NFT logic here
}
```

### 3. Create a new deployment script and deploy the NFT Contract

```
//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

import "../contracts/NFT.sol";
import "./DeployHelpers.s.sol";

contract DeployNFT is ScaffoldETHDeploy {
  // use `deployer` from `ScaffoldETHDeploy`
  function run() external ScaffoldEthDeployerRunner {
    NFT nftContract = new NFT("My NFT", "MNFT");
    console.logString(
      string.concat(
        "NFT contract deployed at: ", vm.toString(address(nftContract))
      )
    );
  }
}
```

- Go to the **Debug** tab in your SE2 app to review the contract details and confirm the deployment.

### 4. Edit the NFT Contract

- Add a **maximum cap** to restrict the number of users who can mint your NFT.
- **Generate an image** using [DALL-E](https://openai.com/dall-e/) and attach it to your NFT contract.
- Once you've made the edits, **re-deploy the contract** to update your app.

```
uint256 public constant maxSupply = 10; // Set the max supply to 10

function mintTo(address recipient) public payable returns (uint256) {
    require(currentTokenId < maxSupply, "Max supply reached");
    uint256 newItemId = ++currentTokenId;
    _safeMint(recipient, newItemId);
    return newItemId;
}
```

### 5. Start Building the Frontend

- Create a new folder named `/nft` in your project directory.
- Use **DaisyUI components** to build an intuitive and visually appealing NFT minting interface.
- **Test** the frontend to make sure it works smoothly and provides a good user experience.

### 6. Enable Gasless Transactions

- We'll implement **ERC7677** to use a paymaster, allowing users to mint NFTs without gas fees (sponsored by you). Learn more here: [ERC7677](https://www.erc7677.xyz/).
- Visit **CDP** to create a paymaster URL.
- Modify your SE2 app to support only the **Coinbase Smart Wallet** for secure and gasless transactions.

### 7. Ship Your Project!

- Run `yarn generate` to create an account for deployment.
- Deploy your project with `yarn deploy --network baseSepolia`.
- **Test the app thoroughly** to ensure everything works perfectly!

There you go, a gassless nft app! ðŸš€
